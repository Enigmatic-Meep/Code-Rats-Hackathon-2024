# Code-Rats-Hackathon-2024
Repository for team Code Rats' game submission for the 2024 UA Hackathon

Coded using Python with the pygames library. 

Additional pygames text module used: https://github.com/Nearoo/pygame-text-input/blob/master/README.md

The concept of the game is to come up with as many words that contain one or more of the letters that are presented on the screen (more points for multiple letters). The player must reach a certain amount of points before the time runs out.
